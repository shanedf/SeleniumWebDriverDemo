# Selenium WebDriver Demo Projects
## Initial Setup
Before you start running the test projects, you will need to enable (for Safari) and download/install WebDrivers for any other browsers you wish to test.

### Safari
Enabling Safari on MacOS is simple as the WebDriver is maintained by and built into Safari by Apple - run the following command at a terminal prompt:
<br />`safaridriver --enable`
<br />(nb: You will be asked for your user password to run the command)

### Chrome
The easiest way to get Chrome WebDriver successfully running is to install it with HomeBrew using the following command:
<br />`brew tap homebrew/cask && brew cask install chromedriver`
